\textbf{Exercise}: Let $G$ be the group where every element is its own inverse. Show that $G$ is abelian.
\begin{proof}
Take $g \in G$. Then $g^2 = e$ and $g = g^{-1}$. We also have $h \in G$ such that $h^2 = e$ and $h = h^{-1}$. We want to show that $hg = gh$.\\
$G$ is a group $\implies gh \in G.$ 
$\implies gh = (gh)^{-1}$
$=h^{-1}g^{-1}$.
But $(hg)^{-1} = h^{-1}g^{-1} = hg = gh \implies G$ is abelian.
\end{proof}
