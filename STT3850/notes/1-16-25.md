## Notes 

- Poisson distributions are occurances in a space and time.
- Binomial distributions are pass fail (bernoulli trials are too)
    - Flipping a coin, pass/fail, etc.
    - The mean of a binomial is np 
    - The variance of a binomial is np(1-p)

## Command list

### R CMDS
- rpois, average occurance in a space and time. (occurances, rate)
    - ex: calls<-rpois(60, 1200) (60 minutes, 1200 calls per minute)
    - mean and variance are equal
- var (variance)
- sd (standard deviation)
- mean (mean)
- set.seed() (for ensuring repeatable randomness)
- rnorm (normal distribution simulation) (mean, stddev, count)
    - when the model is representing Z-scores, you don't need all 3 parameters, only the first.
- cat (printing)
- round (rounding :3c)
- hashtag for comments
- summary (gives an analysis of data)



### Python CMDS
- np.random.normal <- normal distribution
- np.random.poisson <- poisson distribution
    - same params as R for the above
- np.round (rounding :3c)
- np.mean (mean)
- np.var (variancde)
- np.std (stddev)
- np.random.seed() <- same as r's set.seed
- np.percentile <- used for calculating 1st and 3rd quartiles
- np.min/max (obv)
