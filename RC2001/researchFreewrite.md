# Researching

I wouldn't necessarily call myself a reasearcher. I'd say I'm capable, but I'd define a "researcher" as someone who's trying to decipher new information from existing sources. I also believe that researchers are, oftentimes, 
already experts in their field, and I am not an expert in any field. I'd say I've researched things before, things I was especially interested in, but I don't have much experience with it. 
Even for school, although they've heavily stressed the importance of research, I've never really had an honest research experience. 

Researching is a difficult task that I believe is best performed with physical sources, because oftentimes heading to the library to do research on a topic leads to the discovery of highly specialized pre-existing collections of research books that
are possibly incredibly helpful towards what one is trying to decipher.
