### Branch
- Branches based on the flags set. (NZP)
- If the set flags do not match with the flags specified in the BR instruction, nothing happens.
    - If the flags are set, the program counter is adjusted according to the offset in the BR instruction.
    - See Ex1 for looping.
- For checking whether one number is greater than another, just subtract the supposed lesser number from the supposed greater number, and check for the P flag. 
- When doing if statements, make the BR false. That simulates how high level languages treat if statements.
    - (If the if is true, the BR should be false, so the code is executed, and vice versa.)
    - See Ex2 for an example of this.
        - If equal: Z flag is set. (Use NP)
        - If less than: N flag is set. (Use ZP) 
        - If greater than : P flag is set. (Use NZ)
    - Ex3 for an example of if/else

### GETC/OUT
- GETC always puts a character in R0.
    - GETC is a TRAP call (F020) and pauses execution of the program.
- OUT always prints the character (ASCII code) in R0.
    - TRAP call (F021).
