### Low Level Programming

(Intel and AMD use the same x86 instruction set, that's cool)

- Assembly uses opcodes and operands. Opcodes stand for instructions, operands are the parameters.
- Registers are memory locations on the processors. Accessing them is faster. 
- Registers on the lc3 are 16 bit registers. The "bit-count" of a computer designate register size.
- The amount of registers available to use are different depending on the computer's architecture.
- The LC3 has 15 different opcodes. 
    - ADD, AND, BR, JMP, JSR, JSRR, LD, LDI, LDR, LEA, NOT, RET, RTI, ST, STI, STR, TRAP
- The LC3 has 5 different addressing modes.
    - Immediate, Register, PC-Relative, Indirect, Base+Offset
