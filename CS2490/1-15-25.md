# CS2490 Notes

### Set equality

- To prove set A = set B, prove A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of A.
- An intersection is when an element is in both sets.
- For all x in the empty set is a tautology. 
- When proving something is an element of the empty set, you seek a contradiction.

### Induction 

- ^ means and, v means or. 
- In logic or is inclusive. 
- The compliment of A in X is written as A\X. A\X := { x is an element of X | x is NOT an element of A }. (Set minus)
- XxY => Cartesian product. XxY is the set of pairs (x,y) where x is an element of X, and y is an element of Y. 
- Assume the formula or statement is true for N, then prove it's true for n+1. 
\forall n \in N, \sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\)

Prove P(0),
\forall n \in N, (P(n) \implies P(n+1) 
\therefore \forall n \in N, P(n)

- Need the base case, and then the "induction step". 

By induction on $n$, 
Base case $(n=0)$: \sum_{i=0}^{0} i = 0 = \(\frac{0*1}{2}\).
Inductive case: Suppose that \sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) \forall n \in N.
