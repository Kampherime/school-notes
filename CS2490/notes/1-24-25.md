### More Automata

- A notation mention: We can write an automaton, $A$, as $A = (\Sigma, Q, \delta, I, F)$ as a 5-tuple.
- Definition of a "run": 
    - Let $A = (\Sigma, Q, \delta, I, F)$ be an automaton. Let $w \in \Sigma^{*}$. A run of $w$ in A is a finite sequence of states $(q_{0}, q_1, \dots q_n)$ s.t. $q_0 \in I$ and for any $i \in {1, \dots, n} , q_i \in \delta (w_i q_{i-1})$
    - An example of a run. let $w = 10101101 \in {0, 1}^{*}$. An example of a run in $B$ (on paper) is $(q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{1}, q_{1}, q_{1}, q_{1}, q_{1}, q_{1}, q_{1})$ (denoted with parentheticals)
        - A *successful* run is a run such that the last state is final.
        - An unsuccessful one is either A: one that doesn't lead to a final state, or B: an invalid run (one that accesses a state that is impossible to access from the current state).
- Definition of a recoginized language.
    - Let A be an automaton over the alphabet $\Sigma$, The lanugage recognized by A, written L(A), is the language over $\Sigma$ comprising all of the words over $\Sigma$ for which there is at least one successful run in A
