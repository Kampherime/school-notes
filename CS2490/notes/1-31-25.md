### Proof from last class
- Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Let $L$ be a language over $\Sigma$.
    - $L$ is regular iff $L$ is recognized by a DFA.
    - Suppose $L$ is regular. That is, there exists a NFA $A = (\Sigma Q \delta I F)$ such that $L = L(A)$
    - Define the following DFA $A^d$ := ($\Sigma$, \powerset (Q)^d, \delta^d, I^d, F^d)
        - Where $Q^d := \powerset (Q)$ and $I^d := I$.
        - F^d := {S \subseteq Q | \exists q \in S , q \in F}
        - $\delta^d : \Sigma \times \powerset(Q) \implies \powerset(Q)$
        - $(a, X) \implies \bigcup_{q \in X} \delta(a, q)
    - Notes about this definition:
        - There are \powerset(Q) many states
        - There is ONE initial state.
        - For every possible combination of sets that contains the original F's, those are now final.
        - The paths are every possible state that we could've gotten to from the set of states. (I.e., the path from (q_1, q_2) given 0 represents "by saying 0 at q1 or q2, what states could we get to?")

    - Continuing the proof. 
        - Let $w \in L$, prove $w \in L(A^d)$.
        - But $ w \in L(A)$, so there exists a run in $A$ for $w$ which is successful. Write $(q_0, q_1, \dots, q_n)$ for that run.
