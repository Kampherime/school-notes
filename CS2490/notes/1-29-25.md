### DFA
- No ambiguity between letters and the states they move us to. 
    - There is a path for EVERY letter. 
- Just because a path may exist in a DFA does not mean the language recognizes all paths.
    - If a word ends on a non-final state, the word is not recognized. 

- Definition of a run on a DFA.
    - Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Let $(A = \Sigma_{1}, Q_{1}, \delta, {q_{0}}, F)$ Be a DFA. Let $w = w_1 \dots w_n \in \Sigma^{*}$. A run of $w$ in $A$ is a sequence $(q_0 \dots q_n)$ where each $q_i \in Q$ such that $\delta(w_i, q_{i-1}) = q_i \forall i \in \{0, n-1\}$
- Definition of a language recognized by A.
    - Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Let $A$ be a DFA over $\Sigma$. The language recognized by $A$ written $L(A)$ is \[L(A) := \{w \in \Sigma^* | the run of w in A is successful}\]

### Theorem
- Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Let $L$ be a language over $\Sigma$.
    - $L$ is regular iff there exists a DFA, $A$, such that \[L = L(A)\]
        - For proving this theorem, you must prove both $A \implies B$ and $B \implies A$. (for iff statements).

### Proving it
- Proving that if a DFA recoginizes L=L(A), this implies L is regular is relatively trivial because a DFA is an NFA, and that is the definition.
- Proving L is regular implies that there is a DFA over L is more difficult.
