# REGEX BB!!!

### Something practical tm

- oh its grep

### Regek.

- A string over $\Sigma$ is a regular expression iff it is of the following form: 
    - $\emptyset, \epsilon, a \in \Sigma$ are regex over $\Sigma$.
    - If $r$ and $s$ are regex over $\Sigma$, then so are $(r+s), (rs),$ and $(r^*)$
        - Ugly ahh examples: (a.(a.(a.(b*)))), ((a*)+(b.((b*).(a.(a*)))))

- Yeah we hated that lets add some priority to these expressions.
    - calculus mention
    - The * has highest presidence, followed by ., then +.
        - Dot fake. no dot. lies.
        - The + is like a union, the . is a concatenation, and the * is like the * in $\Sigma^&$.

- Definition of... smth:
    - Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. The language denoted by a regex e over $\Sigma$ is the language over $\Sigma$ defined inductively as follows: 
        - $L(e) := {\emptyset if e = \emptyset, \{\epsilon\} if e = \epsilon, \{a\} if e = a \forall a \in \Sigma L(r) \cup L(s) if e = r + s, L(r).L(s) if e = rs, L(r)^* if e = r^*}$
            - Sometimes we say the regex when we mean $L(e)$ :) its a mouthful 

- Examples of reggae
    - 0 + 1(0+1)^* -> All valid binary numbors
    - 1(0+1)^* -> Odd binary nombrs
    - a^3b := {aaab^k | k > 0}

- Theoremememememememememem:
    - Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Let $L$ be a language over $\Sigma$. If $L$ is the language denoted by a regular expression, then $L$ is regular.
