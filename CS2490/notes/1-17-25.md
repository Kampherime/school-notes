### aUATOOMIMATION MENTION / ALPHABOEB T METNION

- An alphabet is a finite set. We use alphabets in ways that mirror everyday alphabets. (in theory)
- Any given element of an alphabet is called a letter. 
- An example of an alphabet is the English alphabet: {a, b, c ... y, z}
    - Or binary: {0, 1}
- Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet. A word on $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of letters of $\Sigma$. We write $w_1, w_2 \ldots w_n$ is a letter of $\Sigma$. 
    - Example: Every binary representation is a word on B: {0, 1}.
- Something to remember: On any alphabet there is a unique word comprised of no letters that is designated the empty word, designated $\epsilon$.

### Sigma gameplay

- The set of all words over $\Sigma$ is designated as $\Sigma^{*}$.
- The length of a word $w \in \Sigma^{*}$ is written $|w|$.
    - By definition, the length of w, $|w| = n$ where $w=w_1 \ldots w_n$ with all the $w_i$ in $\Sigma$.
    - $|\epsilon| = 0$.
    
- Concatenation definition: Let $w = w_1 \ldots w_n \in \Sigma^{*}$ and $u = u_1 \ldots u_k \in \Sigma^{*}$.
    - The concatenation of $w$ and $u$ is the word $wu = w_1 \ldots w_n u_1 \ldots u_k \in \Sigma^{*}$.
- Reversal definition: Let $w = w_1 \ldots w_n \in \Sigma^{*}$.
    - The reversal of $w$ is the word $w^R = w_n \ldots w_1$.
- Language definition: A language over $\Sigma$ is a subset of $\Sigma^{*}$.
    - English is a language over A, and binary numbers are a language over B.
