### General remarks.
- All the words over an alphabet can be denoted ${\dots}^{*}$

### Language gameplay^2 
- Definition of the power of a language.
    - The nth power of a language L over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is $L^{n} := { w_{1} \dots w_{n} \mid \forall i \in {1 \dots u_{i}}, w_{i} \in L }
    - Its n possible combinations of words that exist in the language
- Definition of the star-closure of a lanugage.
    - The star-closure of a language L over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is $\bigcup_{n \in N} L^{n}$, which is denoted $L^{*}$

### Automata
- An automaton is a way to isolate a language by representing states. (i think,,,)
- Definition of (TK).
    - Let $\Sigma$ be an alphabet, and let $Q$ be a finite set of states. A non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) on $\Sigma$ and $Q$ is given by:
        - 1) A transition relation $\delta$: \[\Sigma \times Q \implies \powerset Q\]. (Where can we get to from one state using one word?) 
        - 2) A subset $I \subseteq Q$ (initial states)
        - 3) A subset $F \subseteq Q$ (final states)
    - To draw an automaton, use arrows towards initial states, arrows between states, and double circle final states.
